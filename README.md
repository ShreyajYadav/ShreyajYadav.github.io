#                              Day 1

Monday, 4th March

The first day started at 10AM and we were brought to our seats.
After a while we were gathered up in a meeting room and were told about what the week was going to be about. 
Then we were sent back to our seats to get used to the computers which was followed by lunch until 2.
After lunch we were taken back to the board room where we had a workshop about Agile and assembled potato heads.
Basically, on the first day we were getting used to these offices and had an ice breaker workshop which in the end was quite fun.

Tuesday, 5th March

The second day started with a workshop about Git where I learned how to install git, use the terminal to create files and directories and how to get my Github account set-up. 
After that we had a micro-bit workshop where we messed around with the micro-bits and makey - makeys.
The day flew by and I enjoyed it, I learned a lot on this day and while it was confusing at first, by the end I learned a lot about Git and Github which will be useful later.

Wednesday, 6th March

The third day started with a workshop where we had to build a roller coaster that had a loop, this roller coaster had to be built with straws, tape and paper, and a ball was rolled down which was meant to go around the loop. 
This workshop went on for the whole day in which we had a few workshops in between. 
The workshops we had in between were about AI and college life. 
We ended the day by testing each roller coaster and we had a vote on which one was the best. 
Today was a very busy and heavy day but it was the best so far.

Thursday, 7th March

On the Fourth day we started off with a town hall meeting where we in listened on what the company had planned for the next 2 weeks. 
Then we had a workshop similar to the one yesterday where we were told about college life and how studying computer science in college is like. 
Lastly we had a workshop where we had to fix a python coded game and make our own changes to it. 
I think this day was the hardest so far but definitely enjoyed it.
